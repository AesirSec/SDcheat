# SDcheat
<p align="center">Just a small unlimited money cheat I made for Stardew Valley. My first time writing C#.</p>

<p align="center">Partially made using https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXKEWa0_YJg&t=197s</p>

<p align="center">Alot of things from the video did not work. Getting the Offsets from Cheat Engine in this video is great though.</p>
